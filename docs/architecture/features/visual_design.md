Although the app is intended for visually impaired people, especially those with legal
blindness, it has a visual layout. This has two main reasons. First, we acknowledge that
communicating with the app loudly in public may not always be possible or desired. Thus,
a clear, high-contrast visual design may aid in those situations for minor tasks, such as
checking which activity the app is currently running in or checking if the grocery list is full
or empty. Second, when accompanied by a sighted person, the appâ€™s functionality should
also be available to them.

- VOICE CONTROL BUTTON: The top third of the display is allocated for a bright red button,
which activates the microphone and voice control mode. This size was chosen so that it
could easily be tapped simply by feeling the top of the screen, and its placement was
selected so as not to interfere with potential touch-activated navigation buttons at the
bottom of the phone (screen). If activated, the microphone logo in its center turns
green. Otherwise, it is white, indicating that no voice commands can be given at the
current time. If the microphone is enabled, tapping the button again will deactivate it.

- DIMENSIONS: The layout is designed relative to the phone's dimensions. The button and
card sizes dynamically adapt to the phone dimensions and contents, allowing for the
largest possible size and, thus, the easiest possible legibility while keeping the desired
relative layout.

- LIGHT THEME: The app provides a high-contrast light theme, in which the app background
is a true white, button and card background are true black and button and card text is
again a true white.

- DARK THEME: The app also provides a high-contrast dark theme, in which the app
background is a true black, the button and card background are true white, and the
button and card text is again a true black.
