## Google Maps API Key
After cloning the repository, make sure to add a `local.properties` file to your project which contains the `MAPS_API_KEY` environment variable. You can get a key from the [Google Maps Platform](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/get-api-key).

    If you don't plan to use any navigation or location search feature, just set it to an empty or arbitrary string.
